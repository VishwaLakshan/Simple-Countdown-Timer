# Simple-Countdown-Timer
Simple Countdown Timer (1year project , structured programming)  uses `Timer` and `TimerTask` to create a simple timer that increments every second. It formats elapsed time as `HH:MM:SS`, ensuring single-digit values are zero-padded. The timer starts at `00:00:00` and continuously updates, displaying the formatted time until stopped.
